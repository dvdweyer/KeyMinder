# KeyMinder Backlog

Items are rough ideas, not commitments. No priority order.

---

## Known Issues

~~### Ignored Commands — "Show when filtering" unreliable (v0.1.71)~~ **Fixed in v0.1.86.**

---

~~## Auto-updater~~ **Shipped in v0.1.84 (Sparkle).**

---

## Alternative menu-bar icon (⌘ symbol)

Let the user choose between the current app icon and the **⌘ Place of Interest Sign** (U+2318) as the menu-bar status item image. Could be offered as a picker in the onboarding trigger step or in Settings → General → Appearance.

**Notes:** render the symbol via `NSImage(systemSymbolName:)` or by drawing the Unicode character into an `NSImage` at the appropriate template size; set `isTemplate = true` so macOS handles light/dark tinting automatically.

---

## Show Dock icon when Settings or About window is open

Temporarily switch `LSUIElement` behaviour to show a Dock icon (and thus an app menu) while a Settings or About window is open, then revert to agent/accessory mode when both are closed.

**Notes:** toggle via `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)` on window open and `.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` on window close. The Dock icon appears and disappears dynamically — no `Info.plist` change needed at runtime. Watch for edge cases where both windows are open simultaneously (only revert when the last one closes).

---

## Tip jar / support link

Add a **"Support KeyMinder"** item to the right-click context menu (and/or
the About panel) that opens a Ko-fi, GitHub Sponsors, or similar page.

**Notes:** no in-app payment processing needed — just a URL open.

---

## Right-click to assign a shortcut

Right-clicking a command row could open **System Settings → Keyboard →
Keyboard Shortcuts → App Shortcuts** with the app pre-filled, so the user
can assign or change the shortcut without navigating there manually.

**Notes:** the deep-link URL scheme for System Settings panels is
`x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.keyboard?Shortcuts`; the
app name field would need to be pre-filled via AppleScript or by writing a
temporary `com.apple.symbolichotkeys` plist entry. Needs investigation —
macOS does not expose a direct API to pre-populate the Add Shortcut sheet.

---

## Emoji search

A dedicated search mode (or a separate popup trigger) that lets the user
search macOS emoji by name and copy or insert the result — similar to the
system emoji picker but keyboard-driven and accessible from the same trigger
as the shortcut popup.

**Notes:** emoji metadata (names, keywords) ships with macOS in
`/System/Library/Input Methods/EmojisInputMethod.app`; alternatively use a
bundled JSON list. Insertion could use `CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent` to paste.

---

## Special character search

Search Unicode characters (arrows, math symbols, diacritics, currency, etc.)
by name or category, then copy to clipboard or insert at the cursor.

**Notes:** could share UI infrastructure with the emoji search above. The
Unicode character database can be bundled as a compact lookup table (~2 MB
for names + codepoints).

---

## Global shortcuts from all running apps

Show hotkeys registered by every running app (Raycast, Alfred, etc.) alongside the frontmost app's menu shortcuts — a "what global shortcuts are active right now" view.

**Background:** `GetEventHotKeyList` does not exist in HIToolbox. The CGS non-symbolic hotkey APIs (`CGSGetHotKey`, `CGSGetHotKeyRepresentation`) were probed empirically (see `internal/Experimental_Global_Hotkeys_2026-06-07_v2.md`): the Window Server returns `kCGErrorInvalidConnection` (1002) for any attempt to read another process's registered hotkeys — cross-process enumeration is definitively blocked.

**Two viable approaches (not mutually exclusive):**

1. **Per-app plist reading** — read the hotkey preference key from each popular app's `~/Library/Preferences/` plist. Accurate, zero latency, works for sandboxed apps. Requires per-app maintenance (schema changes break it silently). Practical scope: top ~10 apps users commonly run alongside KeyMinder (Raycast, Alfred, Bartender, etc.).

2. **Passive `CGEventTap` observation** — register a listen-only tap on `kCGKeyDownMask`. Combos consumed before the tap sees them can be inferred as taken. Generalises without per-app knowledge; requires Accessibility (already granted). Limitation: only surfaces shortcuts that are actually pressed during a session — incomplete at first launch.

**Hard limitation either way:** Carbon stores only keyCode + modifiers in the Window Server, not the action label. We can show "⌥Space" but not "Show Raycast". App name as group title is the best we can do unless a lookup table is maintained for known apps.

---

## Compact / keys-only mode

A display option that shows only the key badge column (no command title) for
users who already know what the shortcuts do and want maximum density.

---

## Growth / community nudges

A small set of in-app prompts that appear after the user has had a chance to
form a habit with KeyMinder. Goal: surface discovery actions to engaged users
without being annoying.

**Trigger logic (shared):** show after N popup opens (e.g. 20) and only once
per action, guarded by a `UserDefaults` bool (`didPromptGitHubStar`,
`didPromptAlternativeTo`, etc.). A single dismissal marks it done permanently —
no repeat asks.

**Surface:** a dismissible banner inside the popup (reuse `TipBannerView`) or
a one-off item in the right-click context menu that removes itself after being
clicked.

### Star on GitHub

Banner or context-menu item: "Enjoying KeyMinder? Star it on GitHub ↗" →
opens `https://github.com/dvdweyer/KeyMinder`. Star count is public social
proof and helps discoverability on GitHub Trending.

### Heart on AlternativeTo

"List us on AlternativeTo ↗" → opens the KeyMinder listing page. A heart
costs the user one click and lifts the listing in search results for people
looking for KeyCue alternatives.

### Request a review / testimonial

"Leave a review on AlternativeTo ↗" (or a short Typeform / Google Form).
Written reviews carry more weight in search results and give pull-quote
material for the website.

### ProductHunt upvote

If/when a PH launch happens: one-time banner → "We launched on Product Hunt
today — an upvote helps a lot ↗". Time-box to launch day (store launch date in
a remote config or hardcode it).

### Share with a colleague

"Know a Mac power-user who'd love this?" → copies a pre-drafted message to the
clipboard (e.g. "I use KeyMinder to instantly see all keyboard shortcuts for
the app I'm in — it's free: https://keyminder.app"). No URL scheme needed;
`NSPasteboard` write only.

### In-app feedback channel

A low-friction way for users to send feedback directly to the developer —
without leaving the app or navigating to a website.

**Options (pick one):**

1. **mailto: link** — opens the user's default mail client pre-addressed to
   `hello@keyminder.app` (or similar) with a subject line like "KeyMinder
   Feedback". Zero infrastructure; replies land in your inbox. Simplest to
   ship.
2. **Pre-filled GitHub Issue URL** — opens a browser to a new issue form with
   a bug-report or feature-request template pre-selected. Requires users to
   have a GitHub account; self-selects for technical users.
3. **Short web form** — a Tally / Typeform / Google Form URL. No account
   required for the user; responses aggregate in a spreadsheet. Slight friction
   of opening a browser tab.

**Suggested surface:** a "Send Feedback…" item in the right-click context menu
(below "Settings…", above "About"). One `NSOpenPanel`-free `NSWorkspace
.open(url)` call.

**Notes:** whichever option is chosen, the app version (`Bundle.main
.infoDictionary["CFBundleShortVersionString"]`) and macOS version
(`ProcessInfo.processInfo.operatingSystemVersionString`) should be appended to
the mailto body / URL query string automatically so bug reports arrive with
context.

### Submit to Mac app directories

Manual/one-off tasks (not in-app), but worth tracking here so they don't fall
through the cracks:

- [MacMenuBar.com](https://macmenubar.com) — submit form for menu-bar apps.
- [OpenAlternative.to](https://openalternative.to) — open-source alternatives
  directory; submit via their GitHub repo.
- [Awesome macOS](https://github.com/iCHAIT/awesome-macOS) — PR to add
  KeyMinder under "Productivity".
- [Setapp blog / newsletter](https://setapp.com) — not a distribution channel,
  but a potential editorial mention.
